This repository contains an analysis of monthly average rainfall patterns, from data collected over 120 years (1855-2015), in two locations (Melbourne and Oxford). 
To run this analysis use the following command:

```
Rscript src/make-plot.R
```
The raw data and a description of the data can be found in `data` and the results and intermediate 'clean' data are in `out`.
